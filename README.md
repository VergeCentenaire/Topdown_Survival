Hi! Welcome to my first public Github project.

I've completed the Unity Pathway for developpers, I was totally amazed and then did a break before coming back to complete the Pathway for designers but could'nt finish it because ""life"". Coming back to it was harder each time, the size and power of Unity was too overwehlming to handle by myself from dev to design, then I didn't reopen it for around 6mo now and here I am with Defold attempting something.

On this I'm aiming to make a Topdown survival shooter where you'll have to survive to creatures (zombies? humans?) at least with your handgun. The game would set up in a gloomy/dark place and limited field of view (so convenient!) and in a clostrophobic urban area if possible.

Watch me thrive and crash, but first watch me learn.

# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "desktop" project template. This means that the settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) have been changed to be suitable for a desktop game:

- The screen size is set to 1280x720
- Projection is set to Fixed Fit
- macOS and Windows icons are set
- Mouse clicks are bound to action "touch"
- A simple script in a game object is set up to receive and react to input

[Build and run](defold://project.build) to see it in action. You can of course alter these settings to fit your needs.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
